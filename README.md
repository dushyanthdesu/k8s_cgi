# k8s_cgi

This Web-UI has the capability to run the Kubernetes commands that too the input from the user is taken not as command, but in normal English language. The input is sent to my VM acting as a server and using python-CGI it decodes the input into the command and runs the Kubernetes command and sends the output back to the webpage.
